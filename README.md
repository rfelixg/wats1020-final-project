# wats1020-final-project

The final project in this course is building a custom content page of your choosing. You will need to come up with a concept and do designs to fit your concept. You will create a page that fits into an imaginary site, and you will use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make that page beautiful and usable.

This project requires you to think a bit about your concept and perhaps get a little creative. Here are some concept ideas you could take in many directions:

- Product Page - The "product page" is ubiquitous online, and designing a nice product page can be a great portfolio piece. You could make a page for an imaginary product, or you could re-imagine a page for an existing product.
- Catalog Page - Indices and catalogs are common interfaces online. Everything from encyclopedias to ecommerce sites face the challenge of how to find the right information in a large hierarchy of metadata. You can conceive of several interface enhancements over plain HTML/CSS that you could now implement.
- Video View Page - Imagine a video service and design a page that would be the "home" or "view page" for a specific show. Use a real show, or make one up!
- Activity Feed - Many sites use an activity feed for your home page. You can usually see the activity of your stuff, friends, subscriptions, etc.

These are just a few ideas. You may come up with many more. Whatever your concept is, you will need to refine it to something that is a single page and that you can build in a few weeks. You will need to use many of the techniques that we have used throughout the quarter.

This is your chance to really think about how you can combine HTML, CSS and JS into an elegant package. Put your users first, and work hard to bring together the design and interface. This is also your chance to explore things that we haven't touched in the course. You may wish to try some special effects libraries, or a sound management library. There are so many JavaScript modules you could take advantage of that it can be quite difficult to choose.

That's why we take time to do a design phase on this project. You want to do a little research up front to see how feasible it is to implement your concepts. This project is an attempt to show what you can produce with some polish, not just to show an experiment. So keep in mind that you want to pull back on ambition and pull up on finish.

To help you get going on this assignment, you are supplied with a starter repository that contains a boilerplate HTML file with jQuery, Modernizr, and Bootstrap connected. You are free to discard or replace any of these components as you wish, and you are also free to start a completely new repository and work from scratch if you prefer.

#Base Requirements

- Come up with the concept for a single-page (at least) experience combining HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Come up with a lovely design that does justice to your concept.
- Implement your concept and design in HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Be sure that your concept meets these technical requirements:
    - Use at least one third party library (probably jQuery) to assist with base dom manipulation and programming.
    - Use at least one third party library (perhaps Bootstrap) to assist with some aspect of visual presentation and/or visual effects (you could also use a third party animation library, etc.).
    - Use at least one third party library to incorporate data from a remote service. (This could be implementation of a mapping library like Leaflet.js, some JS components for Flickr or Twitter, or a completely custom API request/feature that you create using "ajax()" or "getJSON()" methods.
    - Use at least one event listener to respond to a user's click. (This could be doing a show/hide on content, simulating a login, triggering an animation, etc.)
    - Your design and layout must be responsive for the four common sizes of screen: sm, md, lg, xl.

#Stretch Goals

- Start from scratch! Generate your own boilerplate and connect in your own components.
- Use an animation library to do a vertical scrolling animation.
- Use another special library to make a very specific presentation that would not be possible without JavaScript.

In order to do this, we will work over the final 4 weeks of the quarter. The following project assignments make up the series:

- Final Project Design Planning
This portion of the project focuses on design planning so you can get your ideas about how you will lay out your project on paper. You should create wireframes, figure out your basic approach to design (colors, fonts, etc.) and define your concept and goal clearly. Also, be sure to outline what third-party libraries you intend to use.
- Final Project Mobile Friendly Layout Research
This research will allow you to experiment with successfully laying out your page so that it properly modulates layout and functionality for mobile and very large devices.
- Final Project Preview
This preview shows us what you've been working on. Media assets should be in place, and the visual design/layout will be basically set at this point. You should have much of your JavaScript features in place and be ready to polish things up for final delivery.
- Final Project Complete
This is the complete project that is viewable and functional on browsers, mobile devices, and large screens.
